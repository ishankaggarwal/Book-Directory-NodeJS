# Books Directory

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` command inside the project
3. For development run `npm run start:dev`
4. For production run `npm run start`


Basic application created using NodeJS and ExpressJs using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

* GET – fetches the book details from the directory. This can include all the books or specific books by ID. 
* POST – adds a new book to the directory of books. 
* PUT – updates any existing book in the directory.
* DELETE – delete any existing book from the directory. 

For this kind of application, you don’t have to use the database, and for the first app, you can start with data collected as a JSON file.
